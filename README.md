# calculato_rs
Some pet project to find all possible solutions
to the ["Calculator: The Game"](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2508960/Calculator_The_Game/) puzzles.

---

**Download** available in [Releases](https://github.com/SEBROVATER/calculato_rs/releases) section.
(You need '**calculato_rs.exe**' file)

### Some notes:
- **Level 155** can't be solved because of `31 => 00`. 
Couldn't find a good enough solution to account for numbers with leading zeros..
- **Level 174** has an unexpectedly large number of solutions.
- Solutions with buttons that don't change anything are excluded (mostly).

### Some hints:
- Numbers can be entered directly or by dragging the mouse left or right.
- `Store` button doesn't work with negative numbers.
